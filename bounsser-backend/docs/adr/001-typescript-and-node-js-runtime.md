## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

We need to choose a runtime environment and programming language for the Bouncer
backend API. The system needs to handle real-time Twitter data ingestion, user
authentication, impersonation detection algorithms, and provide a robust REST
API.

### Requirements

- **Performance**: Handle high-throughput Twitter streams and webhook processing
- **Type Safety**: Reduce runtime errors and improve developer experience
- **Ecosystem**: Rich library ecosystem for Twitter API integration,
  authentication, and data processing
- **Scalability**: Support horizontal scaling and microservices architecture
- **Developer Experience**: Fast development cycles, good tooling, and
  maintainability
- **Team Expertise**: Leverage existing team knowledge and skills

### Alternatives Considered

#### 1. Python + FastAPI

**Pros:**

- Excellent for data science and ML algorithms (impersonation detection)
- Rich ecosystem for text processing and similarity algorithms
- Fast development for prototyping
- Strong typing with Pydantic

**Cons:**

- Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true concurrency
- Slower runtime performance compared to Node.js for I/O operations
- Less optimal for real-time stream processing
- Deployment complexity for production scaling

#### 2. Go

**Pros:**

- Excellent performance and concurrency model
- Strong static typing
- Fast compilation and deployment
- Good for microservices

**Cons:**

- Less mature ecosystem for Twitter API libraries
- Steeper learning curve for the team
- Less flexibility for rapid prototyping
- Smaller community for web development patterns

#### 3. Java + Spring Boot

**Pros:**

- Mature enterprise ecosystem
- Strong typing and performance
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Good for large-scale applications

**Cons:**

- Verbose syntax and configuration
- Slower development cycles
- Heavy resource footprint
- Overkill for our current scale

#### 4. Node.js + TypeScript

**Pros:**

- Excellent I/O performance and event-driven architecture
- Perfect for real-time applications and webhook processing
- Rich npm ecosystem with Twitter API libraries
- Strong typing with TypeScript while maintaining JavaScript flexibility
- Fast development cycles with hot reloading
- Unified language stack (if using frontend JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Great tooling ecosystem (ESLint, Prettier, Jest, etc.)
- Easy deployment and scaling with containers

**Cons:**

- Single-threaded nature (mitigated by worker threads and clustering)
- Callback complexity (mitigated by async/await and modern patterns)
- Package ecosystem quality can vary

## Decision

We will use **Node.js with TypeScript** as our runtime and programming language.

### Key Factors

1. **Real-time Performance**: Node.js excels at I/O-intensive operations, making
   it ideal for Twitter stream processing and webhook handling
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking while
   maintaining JavaScript's flexibility
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for Twitter API integration, JWT
   authentication, and data processing
4. **Developer Experience**: Fast development cycles, excellent tooling, and
   strong community support
5. **Team Velocity**: Faster onboarding and development compared to more verbose
   alternatives
6. **Modern Patterns**: Full support for async/await, ES modules, and modern
   JavaScript features

### Technical Specifications

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ (LTS)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Module System**: ES Modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **Build Tool**: tsc + tsc-alias for path resolution
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution during development

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Fast Development**: Rapid prototyping and iteration cycles
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time while maintaining runtime
  flexibility
- **Performance**: Excellent for I/O-bound operations (API calls, database
  queries, streams)
- **Ecosystem**: Access to npm's vast library ecosystem
- **Tooling**: Excellent IDE support, debugging, and development tools
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with multiple processes/containers
- **Maintenance**: Self-documenting code with TypeScript interfaces and types

### Negative

- **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Not optimal for heavy computational workloads
  (mitigated by worker processes)
- **Package Quality**: Need to carefully evaluate npm package quality and
  security
- **Runtime Errors**: Some errors only surface at runtime despite TypeScript

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Worker Processes**: Use separate processes for CPU-intensive impersonation
   detection algorithms
2. **Strict TypeScript**: Use strict TypeScript configuration to catch more
   potential issues
3. **Quality Packages**: Prefer well-maintained, popular packages with good
   TypeScript support
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage to catch runtime issues
5. **Monitoring**: Robust error tracking and performance monitoring

## Implementation Notes

- Use ES modules (`import/export`) throughout the codebase
- Implement path aliases (`@/` prefix) for clean imports
- Use strict TypeScript configuration with null checks
- Leverage async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with custom error classes
- Use Zod or similar for runtime type validation at API boundaries
